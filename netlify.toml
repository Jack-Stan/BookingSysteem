  # Do NOT force this redirect for every request; forcing causes asset
  # requests (like /assets/*.js) to be rewritten to index.html, which
  # makes the browser receive HTML where it expects JS and results in a
  # white screen / MIME type errors. By leaving out `force` Netlify will
  # serve existing files (assets) and only fallback for missing paths.
